**🌟 Project Overview**
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations since replacing employees can be costly and time-consuming. This project aims to predict employee attrition using supervised learning methods. By analyzing employee data such as experience, tenure, and job satisfaction, we can accurately classify whether an employee is likely to stay or leave the organization.

🔑 Key Objective: Build a classification model that enables HR teams to proactively identify employees at risk of leaving and take steps to improve retention.

**📊 Dataset Description**
The dataset contains various features about employees, including:

Experience (YY.MM): Employee experience in years and months.
Age: Employee age in years.
New Location: Assigned work location.
New Promoted: Whether the employee received a promotion (binary: 1 for yes, 0 for no).
New Job Role Match: Indicates if the job role matches the employee's skills.
Hiring Source: Includes categories like Agency, Direct, and Employee Referral.
Demographics: Such as Gender, Marital Status, etc.
The target variable, Stay/Left, indicates whether an employee stayed (1) or left (0) the organization.

🛠️ Tech Stack**
Here's the tech stack we used for this project:

🐍 Python: Core programming language.
📊 Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
🔢 NumPy: For numerical computations.
📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualizations.
🤖 Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

**🧑‍💻 Steps Followed**
1. 🔍 Data Loading & Exploration
Loaded the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Conducted basic exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Handled missing values.
Removed duplicate entries.
Categorical features were converted to numerical using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding.
3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized data through histograms, correlation matrices, and other plots to understand the relationships between variables.
4. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
Created new features from existing data, such as Tenure Group and Job Role Match.
5. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
Split the data into training and test sets.
Standardized/normalized the features to prepare for machine learning models.
**🤖 Machine Learning Models**
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for predicting employee attrition:

Logistic Regression 📉
Decision Trees 🌳
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 📍
Support Vector Machine (SVM) 🧮
Random Forest 🌲🌲
Naive Bayes 🔍
Stay tuned for more updates and improvements! 😊
